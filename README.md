# A Neuro-Evolutionary Algorithm Approach to Play Connect4


This project explores an evolutionary approach to
evolving neural network weights for training game agents,
with a focus on Connect4 gameplay. We encode a multilevel
feedforward neural network architecture and utilize a genetic
algorithm to optimize the weights, aiming to enhance decision making processes and overall performance of the game agent.

The reserach paper and code highlights all the details of the project.
